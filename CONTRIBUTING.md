## Contributing

Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### How to make a clean pull request

Here is a step-by-step method on how to add your solutions.

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Copy the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", or an SSH key, or using GitHub CLI, <br> `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DSA`.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `main` and checkout to the new branch.

- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Add test cases to your feature!

- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to the repo on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your branch, open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the `main` branch!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `origin` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

## üîç Code Style
- Follow the [PEP8 / ESLint / Prettier / Java conventions] depending on language
- Ensure all tests pass before PR

## üß™ Tests
- Write unit, integration and e2e tests for all new features
- Run `npm test` or `pytest` before pushing

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Dev-Mentorship-Programme/DSA/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don‚Äôt assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

#### Make changes locally

1. Clone the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add transaction rollback feature
fix: resolve bug in KYC verification
docs: update API spec
```

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to [self-review](self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your branch, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: You rock :sparkles:. 

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code ‚Äì not what you did to the code.
