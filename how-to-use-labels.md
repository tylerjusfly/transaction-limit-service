## 🏷️ Using GitHub Labels

GitHub **labels** help organize and prioritize issues and pull requests by tagging them with meaningful categories.  
This makes it easier for contributors and maintainers to understand the purpose, status, or type of work required.

---

### 📌 Why Use Labels?
- **Categorization** – Identify the type of issue (bug, feature, enhancement, documentation, etc.).
- **Prioritization** – Highlight critical issues that need urgent attention.
- **Workflow Tracking** – Indicate progress (e.g., `in progress`, `ready for review`).
- **Contributor Guidance** – Help new contributors find beginner-friendly tasks.

### 🔖 Common Label Examples
| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `bug` | Something is not working as intended |
| `feature` | New feature request |
| `enhancement` | Improvements to existing features |
| `documentation` | Related to project docs |
| `good first issue` | Easy entry points for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | Maintainers need assistance |
| `priority: high` | Requires immediate attention |
| `wontfix` | Won’t be worked on |

### 🛠️ How to Add Labels
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **"Issues"** tab (or **"Pull requests"** tab for PRs).
3. Select the issue or PR you want to label.
4. In the right-hand sidebar, click **"Labels"**.
5. Choose one or more labels from the list or create a new one.

### ✨ Best Practices
- Keep label names **short and descriptive**.
- Use **color coding** consistently (e.g., red for bugs, green for features).
- Combine **type** and **status** labels for clarity (e.g., `bug` + `in progress`).
- Review labels periodically to avoid duplicates or unused tags.
